We are on the verge of change, and some experts, such as the World Economic Forum, predict that the mainstreaming of bots will usher in the next industrial revolution. Sometimes, We can see specialized chatbots are emerging day by day to serve specific user demands as the chatbot ecosystem develops.

## The Rise of Chat Bots – Improving The Customer Experience


With the digital revolution, there is no doubt that chatbots are moving mainstream. The movement is believed to have started as early as 1950 with Alan Turing’s intelligent machine, followed in 1966 by ELIZA, an intelligent agent that could conduct near-convincing human conversations. Even though advances in the technology continued throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s, chatbots did not started truly take off until recently after the invention of **AI Powered One**.


**The rise of bots has attributed to several customer care forces working in parallel:**
 	

* **Focus on the customer experience:** In recent years, businesses have been trying innovative methods to improve the customer experience and cut costs by servicing clients over the phone. Calling the contact centre for simple activities that can be completed with minimum help is inconvenient for many clients. While firms have worked to make this process more efficient, it still takes time. Chatbots can ensure seamless assistance available at any time of day.


* **Facilitates hyper- personalization:** Many CRM , customer data solutions platforms such as **C2CRM, Salesforce Einstein, and Zoho** now include **Conversational AI and machine learning (CDP)** chatbots , as they provide facilitates several personalization such as real-time decisioning, predictive analysis, conversational assistants, which enable sales teams better understand and engage customers.
Furthermore, these AI-enhanced platforms offers the real-time decisioning and predictive analysis allowing users to take the **"NEXT BEST"** action based on the present interaction, purchase and browsing history, past questions, and demographics.


* **Enhances Conversational Marketing:** Conversational AI chatbots improves conversational marketing by employing one of the most popular channels among customers: chat. They automate the data collection process, give product and service information, and assist in the conversion of leads into customers. 
Additionally,**Conversational AI chatbots can connect with customers 24x7** which helps to create trust and brand loyalty while also increasing engagement.
Conversational marketing is not confined to chatbots; rather, but merely a tool of the conversational marketer.


* **Simplifies Operations:**  Customer experience has taken a lot of thinking and technology, including streamlining customer service for developing mobile applications with self-help choices. However, most of these solutions still need human interaction. The current focus is on figuring out how to completely avoid human interaction. Chatbots can help achieve this aim since they can solve minor problems and serve as the user's initial point of contact with the company.


* **Wider reach of mobiles and messenger apps in developing countries:** Mobile applications and commerce have surpassed traditional e-commerce in emerging economies such as India. Messenger applications are the primary mode of communication, cooperation, and trade in many bandwidth-constrained villages and small towns. In such places, chatbots designed to work in these conditions will propel their growth in emerging economies.

## The Recent Hype Is Inevitable

**Most of the today's technological research is focused on developing features and functionality so that chatbots can imitate human answers and participate in more natural, intelligent conversations with consumers. Despite the virtues of this research, we can understand that chatbots' long-term success will be contingent on their capacity to conduct genuine conversations.**

Consider that **text messaging** has been around for almost two decades, with commercial SMS beginning in the 1990s. The legendary AOL chat rooms, which were likewise based on the notion of instant messaging, were also introduced in the 1990s. When the social boom hit a few years later, **"social sharing"** and **"business social"** have become trendy.


Since then, human-to-human virtual talking has been a popular technique to form bonds. However, since the discovery of chatbots, many of them have alternated between talking like an intelligent computer and acting like a human. The effort to create emotions — whether regret, happiness, pride, or annoyance — can lead to a negative experience for users who deal with robots which try to resemble people.


Chatbots are particularly beneficial for problems that are simple to understand, describe, and solve. Problems that are difficult to communicate to a human over the phone are hard to explain to a robot over chat. Most chatbots nowadays are built to prompt users to repeat, paraphrase, or simply try again the inquiry. Users may become irritated if they are continually requested to re-enter information.


>>***“Chatbots are very useful for problems that are clear, easy to articulate and straightforward to solve.”***


## The Chatbots Value: A Better Customer Experience

1. **Chatbots will become increasingly serviceable:** In this case, "utility" refers to anything people find so beneficial that they use it on a regular basis without hesitation. The focus would be on improving the chatbot's ability; after all, a bot that is all chatter and no substance and fails when given a difficult task would not stay long.


2. **First-contact resolution will become key performance metric:** Chatbots that can deliver solutions without having to paraphrase or describe the situation in further depth will leave other solutions in the dust. This feature is especially crucial for the millennial age, which has become the face of the chatbot revolution and is inclined toward quick satisfaction. The chatbot's capacity to reply to user orders or inquiries in the quickest and most efficient manner feasible will increase its value.


3. **Faster Access and Responses To Data:** The underlying data ecosystem, which includes the capacity to pull and exploit data from several sources both inside and outside the company, will receive more attention.


4. **Chatbots will become more focused:** AI chatbots will become more focused with more use of advance AI tools to discern the user’s need, these technologies rely on machine learning and deep learning—both AI elements with some subtle differences—to develop an increasingly granular knowledge base of questions and responses based on user interactions.


>>**Bots will grow as they get more specialized and popular, and controlling them might become as difficult as managing applications now.**

## Key Design Elements - To Deliver An Exemplary Experience


Businesses must begin planning for the impending era of bots. This entails looking towards the future and building bots that can function in today's environment. Many factors must be considered, including bot/human interaction and interface design to rescue customer care from crisis.


* **Decreased Manual Effort:** The reduction of manual effort required for human interaction will become a key feature of future chatbot designs. This would imply eliminating or drastically lowering the number of touches, necessary to assist the bot in determining the optimal solution to the problem. One approach to do this is to ensure that the chatbot provides most of the alternatives, with the user only needing to choose the appropriate one.
 

For Instance, **Visual interactive voice response (IVR)**-like visuals can be best option as it enables the bot react to consumers who prefer to communicate with their mobile devices using abbreviations or shorthand.

* **Predicting The Right One:** The objective would be to solve the problem with the fewest queries and manual effort from users possible by predicting the right one, which would need a focus on the user's history and the context of his or her engagement.


* **Personalization:** This leads to one of the most crucial design decisions: how much personalization can be incorporated into the interaction itself.  For example, remembering user profiles, prior interactions, other users' interactions, the present context, and environmental knowledge? Each of these characteristics must be understood in conjunction with the others to truly comprehend consumers and what they might want right now.


* **Best approach for unresolved queries:** Developing crucial design decision has to  be looked upon when users don't respond as planned or if the chatbot is unable to grasp or interpret the context or conversational intent of the users.
The design here is slightly tricky. Because repeatedly asking users to rephrase a question or try again would be a sure path to frustration, the chatbot needs to demonstrate a partial understanding to reveal which part of the question it doesn’t understand. 
 	

* **User recommendations:** Recommendations can help first-time users understand what the chatbot can help with, also help ease the conversation.


>>***“Because repeatedly asking users to rephrase a question or try again would be a sure path to frustration, the chatbot needs to demonstrate a partial understanding to reveal which part of the question it doesn’t understand”***


## Conclusion - Looking Ahead To The Bot Future


>>*Today, getting into the chatbot business is rather simple. Businesses may easily establish a community following by designing and deploying a basic chatbot. For example, **Google Assistant** provides both the tools and the market for anyone wishing to build and deploy a chatbot.* 


Almost all the bots in use today are trying to live up to the hype and expectations surrounding them, in part with available technology advancements. The reason bots exist is that businesses want to reach people where they spend most of their time, namely messaging apps such as **Google Assistant, Siri and Alexa** etc. which are known for extraordinary capabilities.


At the same time, it's crucial to realize that applications have a variety of ways to contact consumers, and amazon Alexa is only one of them. Developers must be encouraged to create experiences that place bots at the center of the action rather of focusing on technology.


The future of chatbots will pivot around their ability to become useful, maybe even indispensable to human beings. What is the bot's level of familiarity with the user? How well does it understand the user's requirements? Is it possible that future will have a master bot that aids and learns about the user over time? Can it be intelligent enough to grow in wisdom while never crossing the threshold towards acting human? Supporting people and making their lives simpler is the purpose, not stepping into the strange valley.
